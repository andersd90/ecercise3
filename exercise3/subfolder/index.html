                    <h1>Chinese foreign minister says Huawei right to not be 'victimized like silent lambs'</h1>

                    Hong Kong (CNN)China's Foreign Minister has said that Beijing supports Huawei's court case against the US government, adding that Chinese companies should not be "silent lambs"

                    <p>Beijing's top diplomat, Wang Yi, became the highest Chinese official to openly endorse the lawsuit during comments made Friday at a news conference on the sidelines of China's annual parliamentary meeting.
                        The embattled Chinese tech giant announced it was suing the US government on Thursday in an attempt to challenge a US law that bans federal agencies from buying its products.<>

                            <br> US prosecutors have indicted Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on charges including sanctions evasion and bank fraud. Huawei and Meng, who was arrested in Canada and faces possible extradition to the United States, both deny any wrongdoing.
                            Meng has even filed a lawsuit against Canada, accusing authorities of illegally detaining her.
                            Wang said the case against Huawei was "not a pure judicial case but deliberately political suppression," adding that China will take "necessary measures" to protect Chinese businesses.
                            "At the same time, we support the company and the individual in question in seeking legal redress to protect their own interests and refuse to be victimized like silent lambs," said Wang.
                            "We must protect not only a company's rights and interests, but a country and a nation's legitimate rights of development."<br>

                            <br>The legal action against the US by Huawei is just the latest in a long, international battle between Washington and Huawei, the world's biggest maker of telecommunications equipment.
                            In the past few months, top US officials have encouraged American allies and partners to block Huawei from providing technology for superfast 5G networks over fears it could be used by the Chinese government for spying.<br>

                    <h1>US Army vet Joseph Hunter gets life in prison for his role in murder of woman in Philippines</h1>

                    <img src="img/usarmy.jpg" alt="usarmy">

                    (CNN)A US Army veteran was sentenced to life in federal prison on Thursday for his role in a murder-for-hire plot in the Philippines seven years ago.

                    <br> US prosecutors had alleged that Joseph Manuel Hunter, 53, paid two men $35,000 each to kill a woman, whose body was then tossed on a pile of garbage.
                    "With zero regard for human life, Joseph Hunter callously helped to arrange the murder of a Filipino woman in exchange for money," US Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said.

                    <br>The other two men, Adam Samia and Carl David Stillwell, are serving life in prison. Samia fired two shots into the woman's face and Stillwell helped dispose of the body, prosecutors said.
                    The three men were convicted last year after a 12-day trial. The investigation into the three men was an international effort, bringing together US law enforcement agencies with the Royal Thai Police and the Philippines National Police.
                    Hunter, whose nickname is "Rambo," provided the other men with their weapons, according to the US Department of Justice.
                    Hunter's attorney, Arnold J. Levine, confirmed to CNN that Hunter's PTSD was cited as a mitigating factor in court on Thursday. Levine declined to comment further.<br>

                    <br>Hunter was in the Army from 1983 to 2004 and left the service as a sergeant first class. While in the Army he was a master drill sergeant and a sniper instructor.
                    Hunter, who for years worked as a soldier of fortune, is already serving a 20-year sentence over a range of charges, including the attempted murder of a US drug enforcement agent.
                    He was sentenced in federal court in February 2015 over the planned killing of a US Drug Enforcement Administration agent, as well as a DEA informant.<br>
                    In a statement released after the trial, then-US Attorney Preet Bharara described Hunter as "an admitted contract killer, convicted drug trafficker, and ringleader of trained assassins."
